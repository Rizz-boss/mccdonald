            <p class="Section-six-p1">What Do I Have to Do to Earn Points?</p>
            <p class="Section-six-p2">Earning rewards points is very easy, simply 
                <span><a href="#">download our app</a></span> and agree to participate in MyMcDonald’s 
                Rewards. Present the 4-digit code before ordering, or get 
                points automatically when you order in the app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Section-six">
            <p class="Section-six-p1">How Much Are Points Worth?</p>
            <p class="Section-six-p2">For every dollar you spend on eligible products, 
                you will receive 100 points. You can start redeeming your MyMcDonald’s 
                Rewards when you have 1500 points.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Section-six">
            <p class="Section-six-p1">Do My Points Expire?</p>
            <p class="Section-six-p2">Unfortunately, nothing can last 
                forever. Your points will expire on the first day of 
                the month after the sixth month from the day your 
                points were earned. Plenty of time to save up for 
                your favorite!</p>

        <div class="Section-six">
            <p class="Section-six-p1">Can I Get More Than One Reward at a Time?</p>
            <p class="Section-six-p2">At this time, you are limited 
                to redeeming one reward per order. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="Section-six">
            <p class="Section-six-p1">Can I Share My Points?</p>
            <p class="Section-six-p2">Your MyMcDonald's Rewards points 
                are yours alone. Once you have your food, it’s up to you 
                whether you want to share!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Section-six">
            <p class="Section-six-p1">How Do I Redeem Points for Free McDonald’s?</p>
            <p class="Section-six-p2">You can redeem with contactless mobile ordering 
                in the McDonald's app by selecting Rewards, choosing the favorite you 
                want to redeem and choosing “Add to Mobile Order”. To redeem in store 
                or Drive Thru, select rewards and choose the item you want to redeem, 
                then choose “Use at Restaurant” to get the 4-digit code you can provide 
                the crew before you start ordering. For delivery orders placed using the 
                McDonald’s app, select your reward item and add that to your McDelivery 
                order. Rewards cannot be redeemed for delivery orders placed with a third 
                party operator such as DoorDash and Uber Eats.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Section-six">
            <p class="Section-six-p1">Can I Redeem a Reward And Earn Points in the Same Order?</p>
            <p class="Section-six-p2">Yes! You earn points on every eligible purchase, 
                so if you’re redeeming a reward and ordering more food in addition to 
                that, you will still earn 100 points for every dollar you spend.</p>

            <p class="Section-six-p1">I Just Made a Purchase and My Points Aren’t There—Can You Help?</p>
            <p class="Section-six-p2">Of course, we’d be glad to help you. 
                The first step is wait 24 hours; sometimes it takes a 
                little time for MyMcDonald's Rewards points to appear in the app. 
                If after 24 hours you still don’t have points, here are the steps 
                for you to contact us in the app:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select More</li>
                    <li>Choose Careers, Contact & Legal</li>
                    <li>Select Contact Us</li>
                    <li>Enter your comments regarding your order, 
                        including your account email, order number, 
                        subtotal, and if there’s any reason you think 
                        you might be missing points (example: forgot to scan)</li>
                </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="Section-six">
            <p class="Section-six-p1">Do I have to Provide Two Codes If I 
                Want to Redeem a Reward or Deal and Earn Points in the Same 
                Transaction?</p>
            <p class="Section-six-p2">No, you only need to provide one code. 
                When redeeming, provide the 4-digit reward code 
                (found on the Rewards tab)—this will help you redeem 
                your free item while also earning points for products 
                you are purchasing. The same is true for a deal, use the 
                4-digit deal code to save and you will automatically earn 
                points for products you purchase in that transaction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Section-six">
            <p class="Section-six-p1">Are There Any Purchases That Don’t Qualify For Points?</p>
            <p class="Section-six-p2">Qualifying purchases where an active reward, 
                mobile offer or promotional offer is redeemed will earn points, 
                but you will only earn points for U.S. dollars actually spent in 
                the transaction. When a McDonald’s Arch card is used to make a 
                qualifying purchase, you will earn points. The following are not 
                considered qualifying purchases and will not earn any points:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>taxes, bags and bottle fees, other surcharges or fees</li>
                    <li>loading any money on a McDonald’s Arch Card® (gift card)</li>

            <p class="Section-six-p1">How do I link my card for payment in the app?</p>
